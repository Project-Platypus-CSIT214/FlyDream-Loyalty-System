# FlyDreamAir Loyalty Program - Web Application Prototype

This repository contains the front-end prototype for the FlyDreamAir SkyRewards loyalty program, developed as a key deliverable for an IT Project Management course. The project demonstrates an iterative development process managed over three distinct sprints, evolving from a basic structural concept to a functional and visually polished web application.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop an IT software system to manage a frequent flyer loyalty program for FlyDreamAir. The application provides a central dashboard for members to view their points, status, and benefits, and includes interactive tools to calculate how to earn and redeem points for travel.

### Core Technologies:

- HTML5: For the core structure and content.

- CSS3: For all styling, layout, and responsive design.

- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6): For client-side interactivity and calculations.

- Sprint Development Summary

The project was developed using an agile methodology, broken down into three sprints, each with a clear focus and set of deliverables.

### Sprint 1: HTML Foundation & Structure

Goal: To build the skeletal structure of the main user dashboard and establish the core content hierarchy.

Process: This sprint focused exclusively on semantic HTML to ensure the application was well-structured and accessible from the ground up.
Deliverables: A series of three iterative HTML files, progressing from a basic wireframe-like structure (V1) to a fully populated content page (V3) for the main dashboard.

### Sprint 2: CSS Styling & Visual Design

Goal: To apply a consistent and professional visual identity to the application, focusing on layout, color, typography, and responsiveness.

Process: All styling was moved from internal to external CSS stylesheets to enforce separation of concerns. The design evolved from basic color and font application to a sophisticated, card-based layout.

Deliverables: Three iterative versions of the dashboard, showcasing the progressive application of CSS, culminating in a polished and visually engaging user interface with a hero section and responsive image galleries.

### Sprint 3: JavaScript Interactivity & Feature Expansion

Goal: To transform the static prototype into a dynamic and interactive application by implementing core user-facing features with JavaScript.

Process: This sprint involved creating new pages and writing the client-side logic for the loyalty program's key functions. All JavaScript was modularized into separate files.

### Deliverables:

- New "Earn Points" Page: A fully functional calculator to estimate points earned from various activities.

- New "Use Points" Page: An interactive tool to convert points into a currency discount based on the selected travel destination.

- Dynamic Booking Links: The "Use Points" page generates dynamic links to external booking sites based on user selection.

- Finalized Navigation: The main navigation was updated to link all pages and highlight the user's current page.
